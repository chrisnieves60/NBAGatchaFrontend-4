## Reflection
GGC was a about a week long project for a full stack web development bootcamp with the Tech Talent Residency at CSI. Using what we learned in the previous weeks, me and 3 other students worked on making a website that can simulate the gambling sensation many get when doing so. Specifically, from the NBA2K games, as we felt like is a very problematic issue that exists in the industry, where many kids are inticed to gamble for some players that they would get in game. We thought we can simulate the thrill of gambling by adding a currency option, where you can choose how much currency you want for the account when made, and then start to feel that sensation when the currency is running out. 

Although we have many ideas for this project, this is what we had for the allotted time that was given for us to complete the project. Some other ideas we have are: 
* Adding a way to get currency, such as a daily login
* Creating a team with your cards, similar to myTEAM in the 2K games
* Adding more packs, which would need us to add more to the database we made
